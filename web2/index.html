	<p class="paraone"><b>Mathematics</b> (from Greek: <i>μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning'</i>) includes the study of such topics as quantity (<i>number theory</i>), structure (<i>algebra</i>), space (<i>geometry</i>), and change (<i>mathematical analysis</i>) <br><br>
	The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely the quantity of their members.</p>

	<p>The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely the quantity of their members.</p>
	<p>As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.</p>

	<h3>Definitions of mathematics</h3><hr>
	<h5><p><i><span class="hh3">Main article: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_mathematics"> Definitions of mathematics</a></i></p></h5>
	<p>Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Aristotle defined mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.</p>
	<p>In the 19th century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as <i>group theory</i> and <i>projective geometry</i>, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.</p>
	<p>A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, <b>"Mathematics is what mathematicians do."</b></p>
